Gemini API Image Test Tool
========================================

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------

1. API Key is already set up:
   - The API_KEY.txt file is already included in this directory
   - No need to configure anything!

2. Edit the prompt (optional):
   - Open PROMPT.txt
   - Edit the prompt to customize what you want Gemini to do
   - Save the file

3. Add your image:
   - Place an image file in this directory
   - Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .gif
   - Name it anything (e.g., "workout.jpg", "test.png", etc.)
   - The script will automatically find and use the first image it finds

4. Run the test:
   - Double-click "test-gemini.bat" (Windows)
   - Or open Command Prompt in this directory and type: test-gemini.bat

========================================
WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES:
========================================

1. Reads the prompt from PROMPT.txt
2. Finds the first image file in this directory
3. Converts the image to base64
4. Sends the image and prompt to Gemini API
5. Displays the response

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

- "API key not found": Make sure API_KEY.txt exists in this directory
- "No image file found": Make sure you placed an image file in this directory
- "curl command failed": Make sure you're on Windows 10+ (curl comes built-in)
- "API returned an error": Check the error message in the response for details

========================================
OUTPUT:
========================================

The script will display the full JSON response from Gemini.
Look for the "text" field in the response to see what Gemini extracted.
